*By [Alexander Samsig](https://github.com/asamsig)*

This is an introductory hands on workshop about programming in Scala. 
We will start with basic Scala syntax and work our way up to more advances topics with a mix
of presentations and hands-on exercises for the participants. 
We will cover topics like functions, classes, collections, some functional programming concepts
generics, higher-order functions and more.

### Preperations
Please bring a laptop for the exercises with Scala installed and a supported IDE of your choice, IntelliJ IDEA Community/Ultimate edition is recommended.

It will save time if you clone or download this repository in advance.


The workshop will be split into two parts, each part will start with a short presentation
before you will solve practical programming exercises in Scala.

The exercises are located under [src/main/scala/no/asamsig/exercises/](src/main/scala/no/asamsig/exercises/)
and the tests under [src/test/scala/no/asamsig/exercises/](src/test/scala/no/asamsig/exercises/)
